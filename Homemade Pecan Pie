Homemade Pecan Pie

Ingredients:
1 unbaked 9-inch pie crust, frozen for at least 30 minutes
2 cups (210g) pecans, coarsely chopped
3 large eggs, slightly beaten
1 cup light corn syrup
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon molasses
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Steps:
1)Preheat the oven to 350°F
Preheat the oven and position a rack in the center.
2) Mix the filling:
Preheat oven to 350°F. In a medium bowl vigorously mix together the eggs, brown sugar, corn syrup, molasses, melted butter, vanilla, and salt, until smooth. (No need for a mixer, you can beat by hand using a wooden spoon.)
3) Fill the pie shell:
Spread the chopped pecans over the bottom of a frozen pie shell. Pour the filling over the pecans. Don't worry about burying the pecans, they will rise to the surface. (If you have reserved a few whole pecan halves, you can arrange them on the surface in a decorative pattern. Just dip them below the wet filling and let them rise again so they get coated with the filling.)
4) Bake the filled pie:
Bake at 350°F for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes tent the pie loosely with aluminum foil to prevent the crust and pecans from getting too browned. Bake for another 35 to 45 minutes until the filling has set. The pie should be a bit wiggly in the center.
5) Remove from the oven and let cool completely:
Note that the pie will be puffed up a bit when you first take it out of the oven. It will settle as it cools.
